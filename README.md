# Microsoft Graph sample iOS Objective-C app

This sample demonstrates how to use the Microsoft Graph Objective-C SDK to access data in Office 365 from native mobile iOS applications.

> **NOTE:** This sample was originally built from a tutorial published on the [Microsoft Graph tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/tutorials) page. That tutorial has been removed.

## Prerequisites

To run the completed project in this folder, you need the following:

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed on your development machine.
- Either a personal Microsoft account with a mailbox on Outlook.com, or a Microsoft work or school account.

If you don't have a Microsoft account, there are a couple of options to get a free account:

- You can [sign up for a new personal Microsoft account](https://signup.live.com/signup?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=12&ct=1454618383&rver=6.4.6456.0&wp=MBI_SSL_SHARED&wreply=https://mail.live.com/default.aspx&id=64855&cbcxt=mai&bk=1454618383&uiflavor=web&uaid=b213a65b4fdc484382b6622b3ecaa547&mkt=E-US&lc=1033&lic=1).
- You can [sign up for the Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) to get a free Office 365 subscription.

1. Enter `com.contoso.GraphTutorial` in **Bundle ID** and select **Configure**, then select **Done**.

## Configure the sample
